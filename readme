# Cafeteria Ordering System

## Overview

The **Cafeteria Ordering System** is a console-based application designed to streamline the ordering process for users at a cafeteria. This system allows users to view a menu, select items, and calculate their total bill. It was developed as part of a school assignment, focusing on practical programming concepts such as user input handling, data validation, and basic file operations.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: Users can view a list of available items with their prices.
- **Item Selection**: Users can select multiple items from the menu (up to a specified limit).
- **Total Calculation**: The system calculates the total cost of the selected items and applies any discounts if applicable.
- **Bill Generation**: The final bill is saved to a text file for user reference.
- **Input Validation**: The system includes checks to ensure valid user input for item selections and order quantities.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python (for the Python implementation), C++ (for the C++ implementation)
- **Development Environment**: Any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Code::Blocks)
- **System Requirements**: Python 3.x or C++ compiler (g++, etc.)

## Installation

### Python Implementation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the Python implementation.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
5. Run the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   python cafe_ordering_system.py
   ```

### C++ Implementation

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the C++ implementation.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the C++ file is located.
5. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ cafe_ordering_system.cpp -o cafe_ordering_system
   ```

6. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./cafe_ordering_system
   ```

## Usage

When the program starts, users will be prompted to enter their name and the number of items they wish to order. The menu will be displayed, and users can select items by entering their corresponding numbers. After item selection, the system will calculate the total bill and display it to the user. A final bill will be generated and written to a text file.
